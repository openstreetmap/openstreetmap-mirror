General information about
[OpenStreetMap on GitHub](https://github.com/openstreetmap):

 * This is an organization account that contains both canonical
   repositories
   (e.g. [osmosis](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osmosis)), mirrors
   of other Git repositories
   (e.g. [potlatch2](https://github.com/openstreetmap/potlatch2)),
   and mirrors of Subversion repositories
   (e.g. [JOSM](https://github.com/openstreetmap/josm)).
   
 * If you'd like to get a new remote repository mirrored follow the
   instructions in the
   [mirroring README](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-mirror/blob/master/README.md)

 * If you'd like to host an OpenStreetMap-related project here contact
   either [bastik](https://github.com/bastik) or
   [avar](https://github.com/avar) who can create repositories for
   you, as well as creating a team for your project and make you the
   admin of that team.<br><br>
   After that's set up you'll be able to do all the maintenance of
   your repository (e.g. adding users to it) yourself just as you
   would with a regular GitHub repository.<br><br>
   You can of course just host an OpenStreetMap-related project under
   your own user account, but the advange of setting it up under this
   organization is that it'll have higher visibility to people
   browsing related projects.
